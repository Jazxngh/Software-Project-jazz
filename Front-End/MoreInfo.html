        <p> About us</p>

        <p> My name is Jazz, I am the creator of Task-Verse! The purpose of Task-Verse is that I wanted to create this platform is simply because I wanted to bring my vision of having an dynamic application to life based on setting and achieving small goals across both desktop and mobile. </p>

        <p> The reason to this is because I feel that many task manager applications are saturated and unsophisticated, besides nowadays having an aesthetic dynamic functional tool alongside with a productive lifestyle is the new meta for young people thus creating this was the way to go! </p>
